        The oldest classical British and Latin writing had little or no space between words and could be written in 
        boustrophedon (alternating directions). Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized. Word
         dividers and terminal punctuation became common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original
          paragraphos, similar to an underscore at the beginning of the new group.[2] The Greek par√°graphos evolved into
           the pilcrow  which in English manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline between sentences.
        Indented paragraphs demonstrated in the US ConstitutionAncient manuscripts also divided sentences into paragraphs
         with line breaks (newline) followed by an initial at the beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an 
         oversized capital letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of the text. This style can be seen, for example,
          in the original Old English manuscript of Beowulf. Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not
           commonly.[3] Modern English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by indenting the first line. This
            style can be seen in the (handwritten) United States Constitution from 1787. For additional ornamentation,
             a hedera leaf or other symbol can be added to the inter-paragraph white space, or put in the indentation
              space.
