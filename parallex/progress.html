            <h2>RADHE-RANI</h2>
     <p> Krishna as the highest manifestation of reality is therefore considered incomplete without his feminine counterpart, Radharani.

        Described as the energetic and creative power of the Divine, Radharani is, in one sense, one with Krishna, as the sunshine is one with the sun. Just as the sun cannot exist without sunshine and vice versa, Radha and Krishna too have no meaning without each other.
        
        In a tradition where cultivating bhakti, or devotion to the Supreme, is the primary goal, Radha and Krishna are the Divine couple, whose love for each other is seen as the full expression of spiritual reality.</p>

            <h2>KRISHNA</h2>
            <p>
                Krishna, one of the most widely revered and most popular of all Indian divinities, worshipped as the eighth incarnation (avatar, or avatara) of the Hindu god Vishnu and also as a supreme god in his own right. 
                Krishna became the focus of numerous bhakti (devotional) cults, which have over the centuries produced a wealth of religious poetry, music, and painting. 
                The basic sources of Krishna’s mythology are the epic Mahabharata and its 5th-century-CE appendix, the Harivamsha, and the Puranas, particularly Books X and XI of the Bhagavata-purana. 
                They relate how Krishna (literally “black,” or “dark as a cloud”) was born into the Yadava clan, the son of Vasudeva and Devaki, who was the sister of Kamsa, the wicked king of Mathura (in modern Uttar Pradesh). 
                Kamsa, hearing a prophecy that he would be destroyed by Devaki’s child, tried to slay her children, but Krishna was smuggled across the Yamuna River to Gokula (or Vraja, modern Gokul), where he was raised by the leader of the cowherds, Nanda, and his wife Yashoda.

            <h2>VISHNU</h2>
            <p>
                Vishnu, one of the principal Hindu deities. Vishnu combines many lesser divine figures and local heroes, chiefly through his avatars, particularly Rama and Krishna; the ten primary avatars of Vishnu are called the Dashavatara. His appearances are innumerable; he is often said to have 10 avatars—but not always the same 10. Among the 1,000 names of Vishnu (repeated as an act of devotion by his worshippers) are Vasudeva, Narayana, and Hari

                    <h2>LAKSHMI</h2>
             <p>
                Lakshmi, Hindu goddess of wealth and good fortune. The wife of Vishnu, she is said to have taken different forms in order to be with him in each of his incarnations. Thus, when he was the dwarf Vamana, she appeared from a lotus and was known as Padma, or Kamala, both of which mean “Lotus”; when he was the ax-wielding Parashurama, the destroyer of the warrior class, she was his wife Dharani; when he was King Rama, she was his queen Sita. In the most widely received account of Lakshmi’s birth, she rose from the churning of the ocean of milk (an important event in Hinduism), seated on a lotus and holding another blossom in her hand. 
                Controversy arose between the gods and demons over possession of her
