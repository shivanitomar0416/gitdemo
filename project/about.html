       <p class="section-common-subheading">
        Krishna is a major Hindu god. Often called Lord Krishna, he is one of the most widely worshiped and popular Hindu deities. 
        Krishna is the eighth avatar (or incarnation) of Vishnu. 
        He was deified in the 5th century and since then has also been worshiped as the supreme god himself.
         Krishna is the Hindu god of compassion, protection, and love.

                    <p>
           Sri Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudeva.
          But as fate would have it, it was Yashoda and Nanda who brought Him up.
        So, it was not Devaki but Yashoda who could witness all the beautiful lilas of Sri Krishna as He turned into a magnificent youth who mesmerised everyone who came in contact with Him.

                            Balarama, in Hindu mythology, the elder half brother of Krishna, with whom he shared many adventures. 
                            Sometimes Balarama is considered one of the 10 avatars (incarnations) of the god Vishnu, particularly among those members of Vaishnava sects who elevate Krishna to the rank of a principal god

                                Sudama was a childhood friend of Lord Krishna. He was born into a poor family of priests. 
                                Krishna on the other hand came from a royal family of kings. Both of them studied together at the Sandipani Muni Ashram. 
                                They had lived together and had spent time together for a long period
