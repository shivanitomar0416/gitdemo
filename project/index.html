                  The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), otherwise known as the Hare Krishna movement, 
                  includes five hundred major centers, temples and rural communities, nearly one hundred affilated vegetarian restaurants, 
                  thousands of namahattas or local meeting groups, a wide variety of community projects, and millions of congregational members 
                  worldwide. Although less than fifty years on the global stage, ISKCON has expanded widely since its founding by His Divine
                   Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda in New York City in 1966.ISKCON belongs to the Gaudiya-Vaishnava sampradāya, 
                   a monotheistic tradition within the Vedic or Hindu culture. Philosophically it is based on the Sanskrit texts Bhagavad-gītā 
                   and the Bhagavat Purana, or Srimad Bhagavatam. These are the historic texts of the devotional bhakti yoga tradition,
                    which teaches that the ultimate goal for all living beings is to reawaken their love for God, or Lord Krishna,
                     the “all-attractive one”.God is known across the world by many names including Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Rama, etc. 
                     ISKCON devotees chant God’s names in the form of the maha-mantra, or the great prayer for deliverance:
                     <b> Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</b>

           Sri Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudeva.
          But as fate would have it, it was Yashoda and Nanda who brought Him up.
        So, it was not Devaki but Yashoda who could witness all the beautiful lilas of Sri Krishna as He turned into a magnificent youth who mesmerised everyone who came in contact with Him.
